/**
 * Bounded raw-ancestry walk for a *filtered* history page.
 *
 * A page fetched with an effective search/author/since filter contains only the
 * commits that matched, so most of their parents are missing from the page and a
 * lane layout would draw dangling lines. One auxiliary `git rev-list --parents`
 * walk over the page's own full hashes returns those ancestors unfiltered:
 * rev-list's parent chain is not rewritten by --grep/--author, so no filter is
 * passed. `--topo-order` is deliberately omitted — it forces a full-DAG prep for
 * no benefit here.
 *
 * The walk is bounded and best-effort: it never fails the history page it
 * belongs to, and any failure or partial output degrades to `[]` — an incomplete
 * graph the caller must not present as complete (a shallow boundary also reports
 * no parents, which is indistinguishable from a true root).
